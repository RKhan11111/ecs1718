<p>This is a picture of me twice. It was January 20, 2017 where I had moved onto City Science Fair. I never won a science fair before nor have I ever gotten this far in a competition. My project was about the Asch Experiment which would be seen as a social experiment of today. Apparently, I was the only person that had done a project at a psychological level in my school. I may not have won second but being in 2nd place was the closest I ever was to a competition anyway. The teacher, Ms. Conroy helped me a ton during this as it was my first time...besides lacking sleep the nights before in preparation for this tournament.</p>
